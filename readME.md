# Cover-Letter-maker
Cover Letter Maker is an application that generate a cover letter according to the user's input. It means to reduce the amount of time that people spend on constructing a cover letter.

Each year I spend a lot of time writing a cover letter for coop intern. This fact inspires me to come up a piece of software that can reduce this workload.


## How does Cover Letter Maker works?
1. Ask users to upload a docx file containing a list body paragraphs
2. Ask user to a few info needed for their coveer letter
3. Extract the info entered by users 
4. Generate some necessary info
5. Format, Beautify and substitute the info into a prepared model
6. Assemble all sections and return a well-done cover letter to users

## Key skills      
* Python
* I/O
* Regex library
* python-docx library
* Datetime

## Upcoming features
